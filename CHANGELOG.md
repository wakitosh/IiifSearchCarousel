# Changelog

## 0.2.1 - 2025-09-04
- Selection rule parser: accept Unicode hyphen variants and optional spaces in conditions (`A-B`) and actions (`random(A-B)`, `random(A-last[-O])`). Prevents rules from failing to match and falling back to full random.
- Settings form: render Selection rules help as HTML (`escape_info` = false).
- Minor code style and docs tweaks.

## 0.2.0 - 2025-09-xx
- Multi-target search via checkboxes in block form; legacy single target fallback.
- Per-canvas related URL extraction improved; tokens resolved to Omeka routes on front-end.
- Pointer-events fix so only active slide is clickable.
- IIIF Image API `pct:` trimming (top/right/bottom/left) per block.
- Auto rebuild trigger on front render based on interval setting.

## 0.1.0 - 2025-08-xx
- Initial public module draft: background carousel from IIIF manifests, search overlay, admin settings and rebuild job.
